# Maid's Assorted Icon Design
 DESCRIPTION
 
New icons for commonly used items to give your game a bit of a new feel.

Using Raven's Icon Override to remove the need of compatibility patches with other icons. Among the replaced icons you have:

Vanilla
• Food • Drinks • Drugs • Meds •

Extra
• EFTMO Compatibility •

I made these icons during my learning process of blender (which I'm still learning) and decided to do multiple of the items that were simple to do and render for icons.
The icons look rather clean yeah, I'll keep learning to be able to add some wear to them that isn't just through PS effects.

 INSTALLATION
 
Install through MO2 or Drag and drop manually into your gamedata folder or into your MO2's mods folder.

 COMPATIBILITY
 
The mod won't conflict with the vast majority of mods besides other mods that use Raven's Icon Override like Mags Redux in such case just give Mags Redux priority since it will always have the most up to date version of the script.

Note that these icons will match better with UI's like Modern UI or the updated Modern UI 2.

 CHANGELOG
 
v1.0 [22-10-2021] : Initial Release.

v1.01 [23-10-2021] : Indicators for EFTMO and the single Vanilla med that has one.

... Worn Icons to come ...
